# Clock (Worldwide)

The Clock (WorldWide) is my first attempt at handling and working with date & time. It supports numerous timezones around the world, which are sorted on a continent/region basis.

## Features

- Supports local & UTC time on load.
- Standardized EDT, MSK & JST times on analog clocks.
- Extensive list of regional timezones through the dropdown menu, which are sorted based on the respective continent.

## Tech

- JavaScript
- Luxon
- FontAwesome CDN
